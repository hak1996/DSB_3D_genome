# DSB_3D_genome
Analyze the DNA double strand break distribution in 3D genome

To use these codes, Open3D, Pandas, Scikit-learn, numpy and tqdm are required.

To analyze the DSB distribution in 3D genome, you should prepare the energy deposition points generated by track-structure Monte Carlo simulation and nuclear model.
The nuclear model with TAD information can be obtained through the dataset provided by Ingram et al. (Ingram SP, Henthorn NT, Warmenhoven JW, Kirkby NF, Mackay RI, et al. (2020) Hi-C implementation of genome structure for in silico models of radiation-induced DNA damage. PLOS Computational Biology 16(12): e1008476. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008476)
